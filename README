Texas Instruments provides DSP algorithms for the OMAP 3 platform used in a
number of devices like beagleboard, Nokia N900, and Nokia N9.

The gst-dsp project aims to provide GStreamer elements to take advantage of
those algorithms. The list includes video/image decoders and encoders.

Unlike other similar projects there are no dependencies (no openmax, no
libtidspbridge).

The features include:

 * video decoding (MPEG-4, H.263, H.264, WMV)
 * video encoding (MPEG-4, H.263, H.264)
 * image encoding/decoding (JPEG)
 * zero-copy

The advantages over other solutions are:

 * simpler code (5k vs 50k)
 * better performance (4x)

== building ==

There are no dependencies, so just:

 ./configure
 make

If you are using an old version of TI's dspbrdige driver:

 DSP_API=0 ./configure

== tidsp ==

You'll need a kernel with tidspbridge driver, the DSP firmware in /lib/dsp, and
the DSP running a proper baseimage (baseimage.dof).
